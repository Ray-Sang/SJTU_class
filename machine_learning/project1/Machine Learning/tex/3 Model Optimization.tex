\section{Model Optimization}

\subsection{Problem 1 Optimization}
From previous training, we learned that the time complexity is particularly high for the SVM algorithm. The process of training the model takes a lot of time due to the overfitting phenomenon and the intricacy of the dataset, while the accuracy rate is hovering at 45\%. By adjusting the parameters respectively, we can have a better view of how to optimize the model to get higher accuracy.
\subsubsection{Impact of The Number of Training Samples on Accuracy}
We assign kernel = 'linear', set other parameters as default. By changing different size of training samples, we obtain the accuracy respectively as shown in Figure \ref{Impact of the number of training samples on accuracy for problem 1}.

    \label{Impact of the number of training samples on accuracy for problem 1}
\end{figure}

As the number of the training data increases, the training data accuracy increases as well and flattened.


Further analysis show that when kernel = 'linear', and the number of training samples is 400, the optimal accuracy is 49.30\%.
\subsubsection{Impact of The Kernel Function on Accuracy}
We tested four kinds of kernels: linear, rbf, poly and sigmoid. The accuracies are shown in the Figure \ref{fig:Impact of the kernel on accuracy for problem 1}.
\begin{figure}[h]

    \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{figures/Impact of the kernel on accuracy for problem 1.png}
    \caption{Impact of the kernel on accuracy for problem 1}
    \label{fig:Impact of the kernel on accuracy for problem 1}
\end{figure}

The accuracy obtained by the linear kernel and the polynomial kernel is relatively close, while the sigmoid kernel offered poor performance.
\subsubsection{Detailed Parameters Adjustments of Kernel Radial Basis Function(rbf)}
Here, we would like to go far into the case of kernel 'rbf', to find out how the rbf kernel performs under different parameters C and $\gamma$. 


By setting the size of training data at 400 and adjusting C and $\gamma$ respectively, the ouput accuracies are shown in the Table \ref{table:Accuracy of different C and gamma of rbf kernel} and Figure \ref{fig:Accuracy of different C and gamma of rbf kernel}. We select C = [0.1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,6, 7, 9, 11] and $\gamma$ = [0.00001, 0.0001, 0.01].

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{||c| c | c | c||} 
 \hline
 \textbf{C} & \textbf{$\gamma$=0.00001} & \textbf{$\gamma$=0.0001} & \textbf{$\gamma$=0.01} \\ [0.5ex]

0.1 & 0.329703 & 0.329703 & 0.329703\\\hline
1 & 0.329703 & 0.460627 & 0.329703\\\hline

\end{figure}

From the Table \ref{table:Accuracy of different C and gamma of rbf kernel} and Figure \ref{fig:Accuracy of different C and gamma of rbf kernel} and our further testing, we can conclude that when training size = 1200,  C = 6.0, $\gamma$ = 0.0001, the test data has a highest accuracy of 57.81\%, which is close to the highest accuracy obtained by the linear kernel.
\subsection{Problem 2 Optimization}

\subsubsection{Impact of The Total Number of Training Samples and The Size of Sub-Groups on Accuracy}
Assigned linear kernel, we set different size of training samples and different size of sub-groups to test how they influence the final accuracy. The size of training samples is designated respectively as [330, 600, 900, 1200, 1600, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000, 8000, 10000], and the size of sub-groups is designated respectively as [20, 40, 60, 80].

\end{tabular}
\caption{The impact of the size of training samples and the size of sub-groups on accuracy}
\label{table:The impact of the size of training samples and the size of sub-groups on accuracy}
\end{table}

From Table \ref{table:The impact of the size of training samples and the size of sub-groups on accuracy}. and our further testing, the highest accuracy 62.1\% occurs when the size of training samples is 1200 and the size of sub-groups is 30.

\subsubsection{Impact of The Kernel Function on Accuracy}
Same as problem 1, we set four kernels: linear, rbf, poly and sigmoid. The accuracies of these four kernel are shown in Figure \ref{fig:The accuracy of different kernels}.
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{figures/The accuracy of different kernels.png}
    \caption{The accuracy of different kernels}
    \label{fig:The accuracy of different kernels}
\end{figure}


As shown in the Figure \ref{fig:The accuracy of different kernels}, the linear and rbf kernel have similar values, while the rbf and sigmoid kernel do not behave as good as the previous two kernels.

\subsubsection{Detailed Parameters Adjustments of Kernel Radial Basis Function(rbf)}
Same as problem 1, we assign rbf kernel. Meanwhile, adjust the value of C and $\gamma$, to test how these two parameters influence the final accuracy.
We set C =  [0.1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11], $\gamma$ = [0.00001, 0.0001, 0.01] for cross validation.
The results are shown in Table \ref{table:The accuracy of different C and gamma for rbf kernel} and Figure \ref{Impact of different C and gamma on the accuracy of rbf kernel}.

\end{figure}

From Table \ref{table:The accuracy of different C and gamma for rbf kernel} and Figure \ref{Impact of different C and gamma on the accuracy of rbf kernel}, it can be concluded that the perferable parameter C for rbf kernel should be 3.0 and $\gamma$ should be 0.0001.
