\section{Conclusion}
After multiple parameter adjustments and trail runs, we finally ended up with the best results.


In problem 1 and problem 2, the linear kernel function performs better than the rbf kernel. By applying the Min-Max-Module, the efficiency and the generalization performance of classification algorithm have been significantly improved.

\subsection{Conclusion For Problem 1}
For linear kernel, we set the size of training samples 400 to get highest accuracy of 49.30\%.  


For rbf kernel, we set the size of training samples 1200, C = 6.0, $\gamma$ = 0.0001 to get highest accuracy of 57.81\%.  

\subsection{Conclusion For Problem 2}
For linear kernel, we set the size of training samples 1200 and the size of sub-groups 30 to get highest accuracy of 62.16\%. 


For rbf kernel, we set the size of training samples 1200, the size of sub-groups 30, C = 3.0, $\gamma$ = 0.0001 to get highest accuracy of 57.76\%.
