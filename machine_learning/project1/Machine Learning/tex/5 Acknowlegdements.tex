\section*{Acknowledgements}
After going through a lot of difficulties, this project is finally get done well. As it is the very first time for us to solve the machine learning related problems, we carefully reviewed detailed contents in the class and searched the scientific literature for  previous studies. Upon the completion of this assignment, we are grateful to those who have offered us encouragement and support during the assignment.


First, special acknowledgement is given to our professor Chen Li and assistant Zhang Xueheng, who have provided such a helpful and enlightening course, helping us along the project responsibly.


Also, particular thanks go to our classmate, Wang Haojian, without whom we could not have come up with various ideas and optimized our model.


Last but not least, we would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to Shanghai Jiao Tong University, for providing the course of machine learning.
