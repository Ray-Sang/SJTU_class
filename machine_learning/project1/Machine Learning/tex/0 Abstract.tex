This article is for the Course of Machine Learning, School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. In this paper, we will show that how to implement a multi-class classification task by using Support Vector Machine(SVM) and the Min-Max-Module strategy. Also, the advantages of the Min-Max-Module strategy are illustrated.


Please note that the codes in this article are based on Python 3.7.\\
